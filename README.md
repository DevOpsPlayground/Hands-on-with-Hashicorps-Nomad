Set up 2 instances (1 server and 1 client)

run the bootstrap.

Nomad Server:

create the file server.hcl with nano or vi:

# Increase log verbosity
log_level = "DEBUG"

# Setup data dir
data_dir = "/tmp/server1"

# Enable the server
server {
    enabled = true

    # Self-elect, should be 3 or 5 for production
    bootstrap_expect = 1
}

Nomad Client:

# Increase log verbosity
log_level = "DEBUG"

# Setup data dir
data_dir = "/tmp/client1"

# Enable the client
client {
    enabled = true

    # For demo assume we are talking to server1. For production,
    # this should be like "nomad.service.consul:4647" and a system
    # like Consul used for service discovery.
    servers = ["SERVER_IP:4647"]
}

# Modify our port to avoid a collision with server1
ports {
    http = 5656
}

Nomad Server:
nomad agent -config server.hcl

Nomad Client:
nomad agent -config client.hcl


On Nomad Server:

nomad init -> create example job file

      attempts = 10
      interval = "5m"

      # The "delay" parameter specifies the duration to wait before restarting
      # a task after it has failed.
      delay = "25s"

     # The "mode" parameter controls what happens when a task has restarted
     # "attempts" times within the interval. "delay" mode delays the next
     # restart until the next interval. "fail" mode does not restart the task
     # if "attempts" has been hit within the interval.
      mode = "delay"
